# particle-cli Docker image

Set this up so I can keep my Mac clean. This simply installs particle-cli according to the following instructions:
https://docs.particle.io/guide/tools-and-features/cli/photon/

Get it up and running:

    docker run -it visualdensity/particle /bin/bash

Then just go nuts:

    particle setup

Have fun!
